title: Requirements
---

Installing and developing Simput is quite easy, there are just two dependencies:

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/) - only necessary for developing and committing to the library.

Instructions for installing these are located at the bottom of this page, if you don't have them already.

If you're adding a type to Simput, then clone the repository using git:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/kitware/simput.git
$ cd simput
$ npm install
```

Further instructions on development can be found on the [build page](https://kitware.github.io/simput/docs/develop_build.html).

### Git

- Windows: Download & install [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
- Mac: Install it with [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) or [installer](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/).
- Linux (Ubuntu, Debian): `sudo apt-get install git-core`
- Linux (Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS): `sudo yum install git-core`


### Node.js

The best way to install Node.js is with [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), or for Windows users, directly from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
